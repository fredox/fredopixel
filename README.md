This is an old canvas project made in order to learn canvas and javascript. There are some Url params that you can try to change the visualization:
* **grid = 1**  Show the grid of the pixel system
* **color = 1** assign a random color to almost every pixel
* **bouncing = 1** Makes the pixels bounce arround the limits of the canvas
* **love = YourName**  ?????
